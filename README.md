Project management is the ultimate tool for disproving all the worst stereotypes about creative teams. 
It helps us to be immaculately organized. It makes our work more quantifiable.  
The reality is that many creative people are great organizers and communicators and can work in simpatico with non-creative clients. But project management goes further by systemically enabling a clear and organized approach to work.

# What is creative project management?
Creative project management provides a framework for getting creative work done from ideation to wireframing to delivery. 

Creative leads, directors, or project managers typically handle everything from briefs and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to task progress, milestones, revisions, and the final delivery of the project. Creative project management can be broken down into five defining features: 




  - Outcomes: The team defines outcomes the project must deliver. This could be anything from app designs to marketing campaign assets. These outcomes are often referred to as deliverables.

   - Tasks: The work of the project is broken down into tasks and monitored through task management software. Tasks are assigned to specific team members with deadlines and can include project milestones to deliver a draft or wireframe, make revisions, and send for client approval.

  - Stakeholders: Those involved in the project are project stakeholders. The whole team, including internal and external stakeholders, collaborate on   projects freely within the same platform. If you’re a creative agency, this could include your clients as well.

   - Progress: Everyone adds updates on their progress through regular meetings. Creative team updates help stakeholders or clients visually see the progression of a project until completion. This also allows creative team leads to address resource allocation issues or other bottlenecks that could prevent hitting the deadline.

   - Delivery: The team works through a project life cycle. This allows the team members to hand off the creative assets to the stakeholder or client and move on to the next deliverable.

## Project management in the creative project lifecycle

The project management process evolves through a creative project's lifecycle stages. From initial engagement to creative signoff, it plays a specific role at each stage. An easy way to break down the creative project management life cycle is within these four stages:

   1. Initiation

   2. Planning

   3.  Execution

   4.  Signoff




## What is creative resource management?

As a creative project manager, your role is to navigate and plan efficient resource management. There are two major creative resources to manage:

    1.  Team. Creative marketing teams often have varied skillsets and strengths, so it’s important to know and leverage your creatives’ strengths were it’s most relevant.
    2.  Time. Creatives work best when given a set of parameters, deadlines, and expectations around project turnaround–which is why time management is essential.

The key to managing creative resources is knowing what your team is capable of and then keeping them on task
